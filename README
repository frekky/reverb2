Hello and welcome to reverb2, the ultimate in media conversion software designed to work with Echo360!

You will need a working installation of `gnash` (GNU flash) and you **must** be able to run the command `dump-gnash`. If you are having difficulty finding it, I suggest you compile it yourself according to https://stackoverflow.com/a/21023110

Make sure `ffmpeg` is installed, and you will also need to compile raw-multiplex.cpp.

There are 2 main components, echols (find/list lectures on Echo) and echoget (retrieve and convert lectures to usable format).

If you have difficulty building `gnash`, use:
./configure --enable-renderer=agg --enable-gui=dump --disable-menus --enable-media=ffmpeg --disable-jemalloc

echols
------

USAGE:  ./echols [TAG=REGEX ...] https://ECHO_URL/
Ex:     ./echols name=UNIT4321 start-timestamp=2018 http://echoserver.example.com/echocontent/

Starts searching backwards from given year. (it is faster this way)

To get a the URL for the lecture's presentation.xml, use something like:

./echols name=CHEM1003 start-timestamp=2018 http://echoserver.example.com/echocontent/

It should produce a list of mostly random URLs ending with /presentation.xml. Each URL can be passed as an argument to echoget to produce the encoded video.

echoget
-------

Usage: ./echoget <presentation.xml URL> <output name>
Output name may be unit code, for example.

This downloads all the nasty little SWF files that make up the videos stored on LCS and turns them into a nice MPEG4 encoded file with both projector streams displayed side-by-side.
Audio is included.

For your convenience, the date of the lecture you are downloading is suffixed to the output name provided, so you do not need to manually check the date in the presentation.xml file.

Have fun!
